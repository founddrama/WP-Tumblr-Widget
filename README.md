# WP Tumblr Widget

A sidebar widget for WordPress blogs that taps into the Tumblr API to suck in
content.  Yes, it is super-simple -- but why complicate things?

## Requirements
* A [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/) blog to use as your source...
* ...and a [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) blog...
* ...with [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) "installed".
